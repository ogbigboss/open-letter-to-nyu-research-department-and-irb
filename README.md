# open-letter-to-nyu-research-department-and-irb

Purpose: a preparatory piece of (fictional(?)) writing for NYU's IRB.

### How this research is ineffective / unscientific and thus disqualifying
- lack of control of reality (in general) from interfering and causing false positives / supporting confirmation biases

### How this research is unethical and thus disqualifying
- lack of control of reality TV teams from interfering purposefully without telling the psychologists such to create deniability and make apophenia etc. seem real when it is actually scripted

### How this research is criminal and thus... criminal
- lack of control of reality TV teams from interfering for the purpose of protecting their business interests in not having to deal with potential criminal indictments / further brand changes due to this incident (Asylum is a much better name than Pantheon, alas)
