# open-letter-to-nyu-research-department-and-irb

Purpose: a preparatory piece of (fictional(?)) writing for ~~NYU's IRB~~ all potential outlets for psychological research, particularly those that publish research findings.

### How this research is ineffective / unscientific and thus disqualifying
- in the late winter / early spring of 2022, I was concerned I was, for lack of a better term, being "spied upon." To confirm this, I acted mentally ill, feeling that if someone was "spying" on me with ill intent, they would take advantage of this in ways which would prove to me I was being spied upon, despite not providing fully qualifiable legal proof of such "spying", similar to the character Hamlet in Shakespeare's play _Hamlet._ Since then, after feeling fairly certain I was under non consensual forced medical research, I continued to act mentally ill in ways to purposefully help the psychiatrists and psychologists feel their biases were confirmed, such that when they revealed themselves to me, I could prove I was acting and they were simply invading my privacy like a bunch of peeping toms.
  - due to this, there is *no way* to protect against confirmation bias because I am purposefully generating it to disqualify your research being of sound academic basis. 
- lack of control of reality (in general) from interfering and causing false positives / supporting confirmation biases
- lack of control of reality TV teams from interfering purposefully without telling the psychologists such to create deniability and make apophenia etc. seem real when it is actually scripted

### How this research is unethical and thus disqualifying
- lack of informed consent
- it's unclear what my parents know or don't know about their own participation in the research, particularly it's usages of audio and visual technology, and potential breaches of their own confidentiality

### How this research is criminal and thus... criminal
- medical research began without seeking informed consent or an IRB from two faculty, without any pre existing diagnosis or court order to justify bypassing informed consent
  - as intent is required to qualify for cirminal medical malpractice, every non successful argument made in every venue (legal discipline, Columbia and NYU IRBs, more) suggesting any diagnosis as being validated by this research is an argument for purposeful intent to avoid informed consent - why would you need to validate the diganosis via the informed consent lacking research which could only have been legal if the diagnosis existed before the research?
  - furthermore, because researchers need to prove a diagnosis that was not proven ethically, there is no way to eliminate from researchers having confirmation bias as their bias is not simply internalized - if they are wrong due to their bias, they have comitted criminal medical malpractice. There is no way to protect against confirmation bias in a situation where if the researchers can be proven to be biased, they are all of a sudden provably criminal as well. 
- lack of control of reality TV teams from interfering for the purpose of protecting their business interests in not having to deal with potential criminal indictments / further brand changes due to this incident (Asylum was a much better name than Pantheon, alas)
