# open-letter-to-nyu-research-department-and-irb

Purpose: a preparatory piece of (fictional(?)) writing for ~~NYU's IRB~~ all potential outlets for psychological research, particularly those that publish research findings.

### How this research is ineffective / unscientific and thus disqualifying
- lack of control of reality (in general) from interfering and causing false positives / supporting confirmation biases
- lack of control of reality TV teams from interfering purposefully without telling the psychologists such to create deniability and make apophenia etc. seem real when it is actually scripted

### How this research is unethical and thus disqualifying
- lack of informed consent
- it's unclear what my parents know or don't know about their own participation in the research, particularly it's usages of audio and visual technology, and potential breaches of their own confidentiality

### How this research is criminal and thus... criminal
- medical research began without seeking informed consent or an IRB from two faculty, without any pre existing diagnosis or court order to justify bypassing informed consent
  - as intent is required to qualify for cirminal medical malpractice, every non successful argument made in every venue (legal discipline, Columbia and NYU IRBs, more) suggesting any diagnosis as being validated by this research is an argument for purposeful intent to avoid informed consent - why would you need to validate the diganosis via the informed consent lacking research which could only have been legal if the diagnosis existed before the research?
- lack of control of reality TV teams from interfering for the purpose of protecting their business interests in not having to deal with potential criminal indictments / further brand changes due to this incident (Asylum was a much better name than Pantheon, alas)
